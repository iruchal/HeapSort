The program reads 200 2-digit integers from text file “f.dat” and stores the
integers in an array of 20 rows and 10 columns. The program treats each row of the array as
an object, with the sum of the first three integers being the key, and the other seven integers
being the information content. The program then creates a heap with a node containing an
object. You are required to use an array representation of heap, and apply the parental node
downheap algorithm in the array representation. The program finally displays the heap as a
20 × 10 array, a row for an object.
